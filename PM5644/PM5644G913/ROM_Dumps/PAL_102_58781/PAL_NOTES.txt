This directory contains an accurate functional (but not bit-for-bit) recreation of this PAL
which was not able to be read for some reason (either security bit set or accidental damage).

There are two implementations both of which work but resulting in different checksums.

Contains a counter on A3-A8 which counts from 0x00 to 0x27
Then a reset register (I/O 1) activates
Then back to zero

Also has a pin which shifts the data registers. Complicated formula.

I/O PINS:

PIN 14 (I/O 0): Output which shifts the data register banks (SHFT in my schematic)
PIN 15 (I/O 1): Counter reset register
PIN 16 (I/O 2): Unused/0/HiZ
PIN 17 (I/O 3): Unused/0/HiZ
PIN 18 (I/O 4): A8 (Not connected to anything on PCB)
PIN 19 (I/O 5): A7
PIN 20 (I/O 6): A6
PIN 21 (I/O 7): A5
PIN 22 (I/O 8): A4
PIN 23 (I/O 9): A3

I PINS:

1: CLK: Global clock. Connected to all output latches. Required.
2: Used in forumula for I/0 0
3: Used in forumula for I/0 0
4: Used in forumula for I/0 0
5: Used in forumula for I/0 0
6: Used in forumula for I/0 0
7: Counter clock gate. Counter will increment only when this pin is high.
8: Unused / Inactive (0) in operation
9: Unused / Inactive (0) in operation
10: Unused / Inactive (0) in operation
11: Unused / Inactive (0) in operation
13: Unused / Inactive (0) in operation
