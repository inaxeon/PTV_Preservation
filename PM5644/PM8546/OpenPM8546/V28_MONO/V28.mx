/*
 * Y/G CHANNEL COLOUR LOOKUP TABLE:
 *
 * How these values were derived: The hardware appears to be designed such
 * that half of the range of the DAC is full-scale for the Y channel (black to
 * white) and, it is AC coupled, thus, valid Y ranges could be 0-63, 64-127,
 * or anything in between.
 *
 * The below table is for monochrome builds where U/V components are not
 * populated.
