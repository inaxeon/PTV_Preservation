# OpenPM8546

This folder contains a reconstruction of the software for the Philips PM8546 logo generator, whose original software is unobtainable. This was engineered in part by resources released by DK-Technologies who were in possession of some engineering materials related to the PM5644, however not enough to build an outright clone of the original hardware.

It implements all of the known functionality of the original hardware and generates an identical output.

## Features

* Top box text / logo generation
* Bottom box text / logo generation
* Logos in up to 8 colours as per original hardware
* Clock (date/time) 12/24 hr mode, configurable date format
* Built in text editor
* All settings configurable from front panel and SCPI

## NOT IMPLEMENTED (yet)

* Anything other than PAL 16:9
* Timecode decoder

With no example of an original PM8546 available to study, it may differ in some unknown ways.
