# PT8601/902 Reconstruction

This folder contains a functionally accurate reconstruction of option 902 for the PT8601 Analogue Signal Generator which adds the 4:3 PHILIPS circle pattern to the standard set.

The original MCU code is lost to history, and probably only worked on very early PT8601 boards which differ to those in general circulation in unknown ways.

It must be installed in a PT5210 running the "DVG" firmware in this repository.
